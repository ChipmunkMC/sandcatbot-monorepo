# sandcatbot-monorepo
A monorepo with various SandCatBot variations. Based off of (MorganAnkan/mineflayer-notebot)[https://github.com/MorganAnkan/mineflayer-notebot]

Probably one of the worst and most unstable kaboom bots ever, made before I actually knew JavaScript too well.

SandCatBot is the main bot, while sSandCatBot was a version intended to run on a non-kaboom server.
